                    When you think of biodiversity, what comes to mind? Lush forests, sprawling deserts, dense rainforests rich with sound and life, the frigid arctic with polar bears? This train of thought is reasonable and not wrong, however, biodiversity is much bigger (and smaller) than that!
                    <br><br>
                    Biodiversity encompasses all living things. It can be as large as that thick forest or as small as the bacteria content in a single square inch of soil. It can even be your own body, as you contain millions upon millions of different cells working in tandem to maintain homeostasis!
                    <br><br>
                    From the birds in the trees to the worms in the dirt, the ants on a log and the flowers in your garden, the fish in the sea and the germs on a table, biodiversity is everything. Every environment has biodiversity and biodiversity is what makes the environment special, unique, and functional. Without biodiversity, forests would have no sound, trees would be unhealthy, the lush undergrowth would perish, and the animals would be no more. This loss of environmental function would have cascading effects on humans, too! Without those trees, we would have no wood or plants to make pharmaceutical drugs from. We would have no animals to hunt for food. We would have less COâ‚‚ being processed into oxygen for clean air. We would have no healthy river system to get water from.
                    <br><br>
                    As you can see, everything that harms biodiversity has lasting, cascading negative effects on humans. This is why it's so important to take care of!
