                It is everyone's responsibility to help repair and maintain biodiversity on our planet. While humans have certainly done a lot of harm to the planet, we have the ability to do a lot of helping as well.

                At the individual level, there are a lot of small things we can do within our day-to-day lives that can add up to make significant differences. Simple things like recycling, using eco-friendly disposable items or items that do not need to be replaced often (like metal straws instead of plastic, for example), reducing the amount of CO2 we release into the atmosphere by driving less and biking or walking more (whenever possible), switching from plastic bags to paper bags, and so on. Planting native wildflowers and keeping a garden for your own produce is also hugely beneficial to your local ecosystem. These are things that every person can reasonably achieve that will add up to long term benefits for our entire planet!

            Our governments also need to step in and take care of our planet. Stricter regulations for corporations need to be put in place to make sure that they cannot overexploit regions for resources, pollute our oceans, rivers, and forests, and produce and sell eco-friendly, sustainable products to lessen our waste impact. Additionally, significant increases in budgeting for environmental science and research need to be implemented so that we can research and develop better and more efficient ways to not just maintain, but also actively restore the environments we live in and take advantage of. Watch the brief video below to learn more about what we can do to help our planet!
