                  <p>The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is the leading nature conservation organization that operates in more than 100 different countries. They have been dedicated to researching, preserving, and protecting our planet for over 50 years. WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability; and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.

                  <p>Bioversity International was established in Italy in 1974 as the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) to coordinate an international plant genetic resources program, including emergency collecting missions, and building and expanding national, regional and international genebanks.

                    The program was renamed to Bioversity International in 2006, reflecting an expanded vision of its role in agricultural and forest biodiversity and research-for-development activities.

                  <p>Fauna & Flora is an international nature conservation charity and non-governmental organization based in the United Kingdom. Founded as the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire, the society created some of the first game reserves and captive breeding programs during the 20th century.

                    Today, Fauna & Flora works in nearly 50 countries around the world, on more than 120 projects that aim to save nature, together with our conservation partners.
