            Maintaining biodiversity is the single most important things humans can do to combat climate change, prevent the spread of illness, and keep ourselves fed, clothed, housed, and self sufficient for millennia to come. 
In our current era, human interaction with the environment has reached a dramatic pivot point that we may not be able to recover from. Overexploitation of resources in the form of deforestation, mining operations, oil and drilling, fracking, and CO2 emissions have left our planet wounded and vulnerable to the point where we are quickly approaching a "point of no return," meaning that we may not be able to reverse the negative impacts we have made on the environment.
This website aims to explore the topic of biodiversity, introduce some of the things humans do that impact it negatively, explain why it's so important to take care of, and introduce you to resources and organizations that aim to repair and restore our planet to its natural state of beauty and balance.
